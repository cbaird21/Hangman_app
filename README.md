# Hangman app

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to log in and play Hangman with my friends. Once the game is over, I want to be able to submit my score to the high score.

## Acceptance Criteria

It is done when I am prompted to log in,  
then if I don't have a log in,
I am prompted to sign up.
Once I have signed up, I am able to then log in.  
Once I log in, I'm able to play with other users that are currently logged in.  
After the game is over, the winner is able to submit their score with their input being posted and saved to the page on refresh.
